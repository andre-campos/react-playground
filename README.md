# Welcome to the Dev Skills Test #

## How to run ##
1. Clone this repo
2. npm install --save
3. npm run

## Things I did ##
I implemented all the features required on the specs.

## Things I would have liked to do ##
1. Testing: time was short and I was learning React along the way; it wouldn't have been productive.
2. Organization: I would have liked to turn the message dialog into a component on its own. But again, time was short.
3. Form validation
